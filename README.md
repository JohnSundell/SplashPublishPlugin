# Splash plugin for Publish

A [Publish](https://github.com/johnsundell/publish) plugin that makes it easy to integrate the [Splash](https://github.com/johnsundell/splash) Swift syntax highlighter into any Publish website.

## Installation

To install it into your Publish project, add it as a dependency within your `Package.swift` manifest:

```swift
let package = Package(
    ...
    dependencies: [
        ...
        .package(url: "https://github.com/johnsundell/splashpublishplugin", from: "0.1.0")
    ],
    targets: [
        .target(
            ...
            dependencies: [
                ...
                "SplashPublishPlugin"
            ]
        )
    ]
    ...
)
```

Then import SplashPublishPlugin wherever youâ€™d like to use it:

```swift
import SplashPublishPlugin
```
